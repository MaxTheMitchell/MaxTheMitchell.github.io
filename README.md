# Web Portfolio
This is the repository for my portfolio website.  The goal of the portfolio website is to provide a place where potential employer can go to so that they can see all the projects I’ve worked on and to get an idea about who I am and my skill level. Check it out: https://maxthemitchell.github.io/
